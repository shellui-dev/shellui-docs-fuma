How is ShellUI different from other existing Blazor UI libraries?

## MudBlazor

MudBlazor is a mature, Bootstrap-based component library with a large community and extensive documentation. It's one of the most popular choices for Blazor applications.

ShellUI takes a different approach by offering CLI-first installation, component ownership, and Tailwind CSS integration. If you prefer Bootstrap styling and want a battle-tested library with extensive community support, MudBlazor might be a better choice. However, if you want full control over component code, prefer Tailwind CSS, or need a CLI-first workflow, ShellUI offers unique advantages.

### Feature Table

| Feature | ShellUI | MudBlazor |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Installation Method | CLI + NuGet | NuGet |
| Component Ownership | Yes | No |
| Tailwind CSS | Yes (v4.1.14) | No (Bootstrap) |
| No Node.js Required | Yes (Standalone CLI) | N/A |
| Hybrid Workflow | Yes | No |
| Free & Open Source | Yes (MIT) | Yes (MIT) |
| Components | 69+ | 70+ |
| Customization | Full Control | Limited |
| Current Status | Production Ready | Mature |

## Radzen

Radzen is a commercial Blazor component library that offers visual design tools and code generation capabilities. It provides a comprehensive set of components with a focus on rapid application development.

ShellUI is completely free and open source, offering component ownership through the CLI approach. Radzen's visual designer and code generation tools are powerful, but come with commercial licensing requirements. If you need visual design tools and are willing to pay for premium features, Radzen might suit your needs. ShellUI is better suited for developers who want full control, prefer Tailwind CSS, and want to avoid vendor lock-in.

### Feature Table

| Feature | ShellUI | Radzen |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Installation Method | CLI + NuGet | NuGet |
| Component Ownership | Yes | No |
| Tailwind CSS | Yes (v4.1.14) | No (Custom) |
| Visual Designer | No | Yes |
| Code Generation | No | Yes |
| Free & Open Source | Yes (MIT) | Partial |
| Components | 69+ | 50+ |
| Customization | Full Control | Limited |
| Current Status | Production Ready | Commercial |

## Blazorise

Blazorise is a feature-rich component library that supports multiple CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Material, Bulma) and offers one of the largest component collections for Blazor.

ShellUI focuses on Tailwind CSS exclusively, which provides a more consistent and modern styling approach. While Blazorise offers more CSS framework options, ShellUI's CLI-first approach gives you complete component ownership. If you need support for multiple CSS frameworks or want the largest component library, Blazorise might be preferable. ShellUI is better if you want Tailwind CSS, component ownership, and a simpler setup process.

### Feature Table

| Feature | ShellUI | Blazorise |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Installation Method | CLI + NuGet | NuGet |
| Component Ownership | Yes | No |
| Tailwind CSS | Yes (v4.1.14) | No (Bootstrap/Material/Bulma) |
| CSS Framework Support | Tailwind Only | Multiple |
| Free & Open Source | Yes (MIT) | Yes (MIT) |
| Components | 69+ | 80+ |
| Customization | Full Control | Limited |
| Current Status | Production Ready | Mature |
